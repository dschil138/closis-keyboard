# closis-keyboard

Closis is an unibody-split ergonomic keyboard, based heavily on the Pteron44. It features a Pimoroni Trackball.

The major changes from the Pteron are:
- changed to tightest possible choc spacing
- made inward pointing angle more severe
- thumb cluster shape sloghtly changed
- increased the column stagger, especially on the pinky rows
- Added Pimoroni Trackball
<br>

It is currently unfinished and especially unpolished (check that reset button), but someone requested a github, so here we are.

It <b><i>is</i></b> fully functional however, with the exception of the Pimoroni Trackball which currently works but is kind of unreliable. I'm unsure at this point if the issue is hardware or software. If you have any advice please let me know!
