# closis-keyboard

Closis is an unibody-split ergonomic keyboard, based heavily on the Pteron44. It features a Pimoroni Trackball. It's also low-profile, standing less than 19mm to the top of the keycaps.

The major changes from the Pteron are:
- changed to tightest possible choc spacing
- made inward angle more severe
- thumb cluster shape slightly changed
- increased the column stagger, especially on the pinky rows
- Added Pimoroni Trackball

It is currently unfinished and especially unpolished (check that reset button), but someone requested a github, so here we are.

It <b><i>is</i></b> fully functional however, with the exception of the Pimoroni Trackball which currently works but is kind of unreliable. I'm unsure at this point if the issue is hardware or software. If you have any advice please let me know!

The firmware is all based on the Pteron44, so you can use those files, but I did include my keymap file here.

This is a handwired keyboard, no PCB. You can use whatever ATMega32u4-based controller you want, I used an Adafruit ItsyBitsy.
